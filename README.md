## Update 7/23/17

This app uses geojson-vt to cut vector tiles on the fly. Users might also want to use Mapbox GL JS which uses geojson-vt natively. ~~however Mapbox GL JS API does not have search capabilities built in for anything not rendered in the browser window, so those would have to be added separately~~ Mapbox GL JS now has support for supplementing or using exclusively results from local sources - see [https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/forward-geocode-custom-data/](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/forward-geocode-custom-data/).

## Open Parcel Viewer

This open data parcel viewer is a client-side app that uses Leaflet to render a whole county parcel map without the need for a GIS server. Try out the [demo](https://reyemtm.github.io/parcel-viewer/). This app also includes my modern-ui custom style for the search bar and layer control.

## Sites Using the Open Parcel Viewer
 - [Scott Township - Lackawanna County, Pa.](http://scotttownship.gisassetmanager.com/)

## Features
 - Search by any field or multiple fields, such as Name and/or Parcel ID
 - Sidebar, fullscreen, location, printing (using browser print dialog)
 - Render up to (approx) 50k parcels
 - Customized layer control with thumbnails
 - Similar performance on mobile and desktop

## Requirements
 - Data in topojson format, stored in the data folder - see [mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org)
 - A string field in the data titled 'index' to house the searchable attributes (with a separator - see the example)
 - Jekyll (or download the zip file and build the app manually)
 - A free Mapbox API key for using the Mapbox imagery (not necessary, the esri imagery could be used instead)
 - A (free) web server such as GitHub, surge.sh, others...

## Upgrades - Contributions Welcome
 - Create an npm package for the js dependencies
 - Convert from L.TileLayer.Canvas to L.GridLayer to be compatible with Leaflet 1.0
 - Make a Jekyll option for using vector tiles styled in Mapbox
 - Create a function to automatically split the index field and push all the index 'fields' to the popup or the sidebar
 - Add an option to add/remove more/other tools to/from the toolbar
 - Convert the toolbar from using leaflet-top leaflet-left to a new customized leaflet control
 - Documentation on the various options in geojson-vt and the drawing on canvas function
 - Add real support for multiple field search - possibly using fuse or typehead (like Leaflet Bootstrap)

## Issues
 - ~~Past zoom level 18 the parcels disappear - this is an upstream issue with geojson-vt~~ Fixed 04/2016 - The default maxZoom for L.tileLayer.canvas (and L.tileLayer) is 18. In the L.CanvasTiles.js this has been changed to 22.
 - Pinch and zoom on touch devices causes strange behavior so it is disabled, use the zoom buttons (behind the sidebar) instead
 - Zoom animations have been limited to 2 zoom levels for better performance

## Thanks
This app relies on a variety of plugins, but most importantly on the work of [mourner](https://github.com/mourner), [Sumbera](https://github.com/Sumbera), [Stephano Cudini](https://github.com/stefanocudini/) and [Matthew Bloch](https://github.com/mbloch).

This app is powered by Jekyll.
